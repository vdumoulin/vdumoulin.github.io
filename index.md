I am a Research Scientist in the [Google Brain, Montreal](https://research.google/locations/montreal/) team. I completed my Ph.D. at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Université de
Montréal under the supervison of [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/person/bengio-yoshua/) and [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/).

I am interested in few-shot classification, multi-task learning, and generative modeling.
