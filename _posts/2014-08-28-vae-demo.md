This is a tiny post to advertise the demo (available
[here](http://vdumoulin.github.io/morphing_faces)) I built using a variational
autoencoder trained on images of faces.

There is an online version, but if you have the required Python dependencies
installed (numpy and matplotlib), I _strongly_ recommend you check out the
offline demo, which is smoother and more interactive.

Have fun!
