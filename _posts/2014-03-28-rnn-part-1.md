This week I focused on training an RNN to solve our task. The RNN's structure
is really simple: it maps the _k_ previous samples and the phone of the sample
to predict to a recurrent hidden layer, which itself linearly maps to the
output. The input is a sliding window of fixed length over the sequence and the
phones information.

For starters, I'm interested in overfitting a _single_ utterance, i.e. given the
first _k_ samples of the sequence and a sequence of phone information, I'd like
to be able to perfectly reconstruct the whole sequence. I trained my [toy RNN
model](https://github.com/vdumoulin/research/blob/master/code/pylearn2/models/rnn.py)
using [this script](https://github.com/vdumoulin/research/blob/master/experiments/timit/rnn.yaml)
and then compared the original sequence with two types of reconstructions:

1. the reconstruction you get when sequentially predictiong the next sample
   using the ground truth as the _k_ previous samples and the phone information
2. the reconstruction you get when sequentially predictiong the next sample
   using the previously-predicted samples as the _k_ previous samples and the
   phone information

Here are the original, ground-truth-based reconstruction and prediction-based
reconstruction audio files, respectively:

<audio src="{{ site.url }}/sounds/original.wav" controls </audio>

<audio src="{{ site.url }}/sounds/reconstruction.wav" controls </audio>

<audio src="{{ site.url }}/sounds/prediction.wav" controls </audio>

For reference, the model converges to a 0.426 mean squared error, although this
number cannot be compared with other experiments. As you can see, although the
model isn't that bad for ground-truth-based reconstruction, it performs _very_
poorly when the only information available is the _k_ first samples of the
sequence and the phone information.

Note that I haven't tried to apply the good practice recommendations for RNNs
(i.e. gradient clipping and regularization) yet; for now I was interested in
running a quick experiment and making sure my code and scripts were working
properly.

One interesting thing I noticed was that I had to keep the number of recurrent
hidden units quite low (in the order of 100 units), otherwise the error would
start to go up during training (is there an exploding gradient effect at play
when increasing the number of hidden units?).

Next week I'd like to implement regularization and gradient clipping techniques
in my toy RNN and see if it improves results.
