This week I'm focusing on training an RNN to solve our task. The RNN's structure
is really simple: it maps the _k_ previous samples and the phone of the sample
to predict to a recurrent hidden layer, which itself linearly maps to the
output. The input is a sliding window of fixed length over the sequence and the
phones information.

For starters, I'm interested in overfitting a _single_ utterance, i.e. given the
first _k_ samples of the sequence and a sequence of phone information, I'd like
to be able to perfectly reconstruct the whole sequence.
