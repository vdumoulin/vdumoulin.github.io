I'm almost done implementing a first version the TIMIT dataset in `Pylearn2`.
You can find the code in my
[public research repository](https://github.com/vdumoulin/research).

This comes with good news and bad news, but first, a little info on how I did
it.

### The challenge

My goal was to implement a dataset that can provide as training examples
sequences of _k_ audio frames as features and the following frame as target. The
frames have a fixed length, and can overlap by a fixed number of samples.

A naive approach would be to allocate a new 2D numpy array and fill it with
every example you can generate from your audio sequence. This approach does not
scale, and here's why: say you have 200 acoustic samples that you need to
separate into 20-samples-long frames overlapping by 5 samples. Allocating memory
for each frame would involve having 13 distinct frames: frame 1 gets samples 1
through 20, frame 2 gets samples 15 through 35, ..., frame 13 gets samples 180
through 200. Already, you can see the overlap adds 60 duplicated frames if you
were to enumerate them explicitly. It gets worse, though: say you want to
predict the next frame based on the two previous frames. Then your training set
would have 11 examples: the first example gets frames 1 and 2 as features and
frame 3 as target, the second example gets frames 2 and 3 as features and frame
4 as target, ..., the eleventh example gets frame 11 and 12 as features and
frame 13 as target. If you were to list all examples explicitly, you would have
660 acoustic samples, more than _three times_ the length of your original audio
sequence. When dealing with thousands of audio sequences of thousands of
acoustic samples each, this quickly becomes impractical.

### Towards a solution

Obviously, any practical solution would involve keeping a compact representation
of the data in memory and having some sort of mapping to the training examples.

One nice thing about `numpy` is that it gives you the ability to manipulate the
[strides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_of_an_array) of your arrays. This
makes it possible to create a view of a numpy array in which data is segmented
into overlapping frames without touching to the actual array (see
[this script](http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/SegmentAxis?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=segmentaxis.py)).

What you can do, then, is to ...
