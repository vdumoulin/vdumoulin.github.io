_This semester I'm taking Yoshua Bengio's representation learning class
(IFT6266). In addition to formal evaluation, we're also evaluated in the context
of a big class project, in which we compete against each other to find the best
solution to a machine learning problem. We're to maintain a blog detailing our
progress, and we can cite or be cited by other students, in analogy to what's
done in actual research._
