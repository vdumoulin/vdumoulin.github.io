I'm a Ph.D. student in the [LISA](http://lisa.iro.umontreal.ca/) lab at
Université de Montréal, under the supervision of
[Yoshua Bengio](www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/) and
[Aaron Courville](aaroncourville.wordpress.com/)

Right now I'm mostly working on RBMs, with an emphasis on physical
implementation of RBMs.
