![Vincent Dumoulin]({{ site.url }}/images/me.jpg)

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [MILA](https://mila.umontreal.ca/) in Université de
Montréal. I am co-advised by
[Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/) and
[Aaron Courville](http://aaroncourville.wordpress.com/)

I am interested in generative modelling applied to computer vision.
